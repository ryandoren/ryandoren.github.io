Line of code: A single command. Program: A collection of lines of code that serve one or more overall functions. Input (files, user input, websites) üëâ code üëâ output (files, screen, sound) Compile: To translate human-readable computer code into low-level commands the computer can execute. In the programming flow, this functions as reading over code and looking for errors. (proofreading by compilers) Run/Excution: Running some code and having it actually perform its operations. Compiling just makes sure what we told the program to do makes sense; running checks whether the program actually do what we want it to do. Compilation could potentially be skipped. Languages that require compilation are called static/compiled languages. Languages that do not require compilation are called dynamic/interpreted languages. Nonetheless though, even with dynamic languages, we often mimic the workflow of static languages.

Popularity of different languages C++ and C# are two successors to the programming language C, which is a low-level language used a lot in developing operating systems, video games, and other highly complex programs. C++ adds a few more features to C, while C# is more of a high-level version. Java, C, C++, and C# are static, compiled languages; Python is the top dynamic, scripting language on this list.
