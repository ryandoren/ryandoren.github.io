Line of code: A single command. Program: A collection of lines of code that serve one or more overall functions. Input (files, user input, websites) 👉 code 👉 output (files, screen, sound) Compile: To translate human-readable computer code into low-level commands the computer can execute. In the programming flow, this functions as reading over code and looking for errors. (proofreading by compilers) Run/Excution: Running some code and having it actually perform its operations. Compiling just makes sure what we told the program to do makes sense; running checks whether the program actually do what we want it to do. Compilation could potentially be skipped. Languages that require compilation are called static/compiled languages. Languages that do not require compilation are called dynamic/interpreted languages. Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: interpreters and compilers. An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations. A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts running. In this case, the high-level program is called the source code, and the translated program is called the object code or the executable. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation. Many modern languages use both processes. They are first compiled into a lower level language, called byte code, and then interpreted by a program called a virtual machine. Python uses both processes, but because of the way programmers interact with it, it is usually considered an interpreted language.

Popularity of different languages C++ and C# are two successors to the programming language C, which is a low-level language used a lot in developing operating systems, video games, and other highly complex programs. C++ adds a few more features to C, while C# is more of a high-level version. Java, C, C++, and C# are static, compiled languages; Python is the top dynamic, scripting language on this list.

Python abstracts further away from the inner workings of the computer than lower-level languages (like memory management), thus is easier to use. Python is dynamic \u0026 interpreted, which means that Python will run our code line by line when we ask it to without trying to compile it first. That opens up the possibility of using Python in a command line interface where we write and run lines of code one at a time. Whereas in the scripting mode, we write a bunch of code, then run it all at once. The main takeaway of Python being an interpreted language is that we might not be aware of errors until we actually try to run those lines.

Compilation errors in writing programs are often similar to grammatical errors in writing essays. sytax errors: code that doesn’t work with the current programming language. name errors: code that tries to use something that doesn’t exist. type errors: code that matches different types together, which doesn’t make sense. Depending on the language, some of these might turn up as runtime errors instead. Runtime errors: Errors that arise when trying to actually execute the code. Languages that don’t have compilation will only have runtime errors. Even languages that do require compilation can have runtime errors because we can’t anticipate every error just by looking at the code. Divide by zero errors: code that divides a value by zero. Null errors: code that refers to some variable that has no value. Memory errors: code that surpasses your computer’s memory.

Rubber Duck Debugging: A form of debugging where the programmer explains the logic, goals, and operations to an inanimate listener to methodically step through the code. The point is when faced with a hard to solve problem, try explaining it from scratch. Oftentimes, you’ll find the solution. Rubber duck debugging was introduced by the 1999 book The Pragmatic Programmer, and it refers to a programmer who carried around a rubber duck to which to explain problems. By explaining things to the duck, the programmer often found the solution.
