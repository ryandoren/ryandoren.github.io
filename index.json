(proofreading by compilers) -Run: When the program is actually executed. Compiling just makes sure what we told the program to do makes sense; running checks whether the program actually do what we want it to do. Compilation could potentially be skipped. -Languages that require compilation are called static/compiled languages. -Languages that do not require compilation are called dynamic/interpreted languages. Nonetheless though, even with dynamic languages, we often mimic the workflow of static languages.
