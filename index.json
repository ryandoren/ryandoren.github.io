Object: An object is a custom data structure that organizes and encapsulates variables and methods into a single data type. It is used near-interchangeably with “instance.” It’s like the general ‘prototype’ or ‘template’. Class: A custom data type comprised of multiple variables and/or methods. Instances or objects are created based on the template provided by the class. A class is a generic structure for a certain kind of data. An instance, on the other hand, is a specific example.

It initializes an instance of that class. self is a keyword that tells Python to define variables for the instance as a whole. Any other code inside this class would be able to see those variables, as long as it accessed them with self as well. Besides, because it starts with self, the variable age exists, as long as this class or this instance exists. But if we left off self, then the variable would cease to exist at the end of this method. Every method defined inside a class should have self as the first parameter. We’ll never have to pass in an argument for it though. Self by default just sees all the variables associated with this instance of the class. Preceding these variable names with the word self just tells Python that the scope of these variables is the entire lifespan of this instance of the class. When we call the class name to create an instance, the color of the class name that was called is the same as __init__. The reason is that when we call the class, it actually calls our init function. This creates a new instance of this class and then returns that instance to be set equal to the variable name on the left. Benefits of using objects instead of dictionaries: With a dictionary, we might not have created a certain key. But with classes, we guarantee that every variable created in that initializer actually exists. Classes can have methods as well as variables. Dictionaries were purely ways of organizing data, but that data couldn’t do anything on its own. Dictionaries only store data, whereas classes can themselves act on data.

It helps avoid modification or misuse of data by other functions or programs. Methods are what make encapsulation truly powerful in classes. A method is a function defined inside of a class. The method scope is defined as the normal scope of a function for that language plus any variables that are visible in the instance of the class as a whole. In practice, the four common method types we’ve' discussed above – constructors, destructors, getters, and setters – are more important to other languages than to Python. Constructors are present, but you’ll rarely use destructors in Python; and getters and setters are antithetical to “Pythonic” thinking. Python doesn’t provide privacy options for its variables and methods. There is no way to bindingly mark a variable or method in a Python class as private, meaning that other code can always access variables directly. By convention, we often perceive variables or methods that we don’t want other classes or functions to access with a double underscore. The double underscore simply informs other areas of the code that those methods or variables are not meant to be used to access data that way. __init__ is the constructor in Python. And as a function defined inside of a class, it has a parameter list. Self is always the first parameter for any method that we define inside of a class, but it doesn’t have to be the only one. #Define the class Person class Person: #Create a new instance of Person def __init__(self, firstname=\"[no first name]\", lastname=\"[no last name\"): self.firstname = firstname self.lastname = lastname self.eyecolor = \"[no eye color]\" self.age = -1 myPerson1 = Person() print(myPerson1.firstname) # [no first name] myPerson2 = Person(firstname = \"David\") print(myPerson2.firstname) # David myPerson3 = Person(\"Vrushali\") print(myPerson3.firstname) # Vrushali Part of the benefit of getters and setters was that they allow us to run some code whenever a variable is accessed or modified. #Define class BankAccount class BankAccount: #Initialize balance to 0 def __init__(self, name, balance = 0.0): self.log(\"Account created!\") self.name = name self.balance = balance def getBalance(self): #Getter for balance self.log(\"Balance checked at \" + str(self.balance)) return self.balance def setBalance(self, newBalance): #Setter for balance self.log(\"Balance changed to \" + str(newBalance)) self.balance = newBalance def log(self, message): #Logging method myLog = open(\"Log.txt\", \"a\") print(message, file = myLog) myLog.close() myBankAccount = BankAccount(\"David Joyner\") myBankAccount.setBalance(20.0) print(myBankAccount.getBalance()) The log() method will take as a parameter, the message to be logged; and its operation is to automatically open my log, print the message to that log, and then close that log. So every time an account is created, or the balance is checked, or the balance is changed, those operations will get logged to my log file. getBalance() is a getter for getting the balance. Its main function is to return the balance, which is the same thing as accessing the balance directly. It’s also going to log every time the balance is checked. setBalance() is a setter that sets the value equal to a new balance, and it also logs that as well. We could actually create methods to do whatever we want. And in fact, if we were really designing a bank account class like we were designing here, we probably don’t want a set balance method. How often do we just wipe out the previous balance and set it equal to a new value. That’s not the way we usually use bank accounts. Usually we use them by making deposits and making withdrawals. class BankAccount: def __init__(self, name, balance = 0.0): self.log(\"Account created!\") self.name = name self.balance = balance def getBalance(self): self.log(\"Balance checked at \" + str(self.balance)) return self.balance ","date":"2021-12-25","objectID":"/gatech-cs1301xiv/:1:4","tags":null,"title":"Gatech CS1301xIV","uri":"/gatech-cs1301xiv/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Advanced Topics in Classes in Python Combining Classes: 1| class Name: 2| def __init__(self, firstname, lastname): 3| self.firstname = firstname 4| self.lastname = lastname 5| 6| class Student: 7| def __init__(self, studentName, enrolled): 8| self.studentName = studentName 9| self.GPA = 0.0 10| self.creditHours = 0 11| self.enrolled = enrolled 12| self.classes = [] # Legal ways to create a new instance of Student: newStudent = Student(Name(\"David\", \"Joyner\"), True) newName = Name(\"David\", \"Joyner\") newStudent = Student(newName, True) newStudent = Student(\"David Joyner\", True) Instances as arguments (1) class Person: def __init__(self, name, age, father=None, mother=None): self.name = name self.age = age self.father = father self.mother = mother person1=Person(\"Mr. Burdell\",53) person2=Person(\"Mrs. Burdell\",53) george_p=Person(\"George P.

So if the new one changes the variables, it changes them from the old one as well. Lists, dictionaries, objects, and most other data types in Python behave this way: they are mutable.

It’s not just changing its own local copy, it’s changing the real values of the variables. And so we see in the end that the strings themselves have been converted to all capital letters. It’s not actually changing the firstname and lastname, it’s changing what name.firstname and name.lastname point at. But when we have capitalizeString instead of capitalizeName, we pass the strings for first name and last name directly instead of passing the name object that contains them. The result here is exactly the opposite, and the reason is that strings are immutable. Here, though, it doesn’t have access to name dot anything. So it can’t change what name is pointing at. It tries to change the value of the string itself, but it has no access to the original variable name, so it can’t actually change the values of first name and last name as far as name is concerned. So the takeaway here is that any operations we make on mutable objects, like name, propagate back out to the code that called that function. Any operations we make to immutable types, like just the plain string, do not propagate out to our main function or to our main code. Then what do you do if you want to make an actual copy of an instance, such that you can actually modify it separately? The basic principle is that you must copy it at the level of the immutable data types (string and integer are immutable, but self-defined classes are mutable). We have to construct a new instance of person and pass in those immutable data types as arguments, as opposed to just setting myPerson2 directly equal to myPerson1. This forces the computer to create a new instance of person, with its own variables for name, eye color, and age. class Person: def __init__(self, name, eyecolor, age): self.name = name self.eyecolor = eyec","date":"2021-12-25","objectID":"/gatech-cs1301xiv/:1:5","tags":null,"title":"Gatech CS1301xIV","uri":"/gatech-cs1301xiv/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Polymorphism and Inheritance and Abstraction Abstraction: A principle of object-oriented programming that states that only essential information should be made visible to the outside program.

Usually when discussing complexity we talk in terms of worst case scenarios, also known as “upper bounds” on how long something could take. Big O Notation: A notation for expressing the worst-case efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the size of the input. Big o is a measure of algorithmic complexity. In big o we ask, given a data set of size n, how many operations are required to complete this algorithm? However, what we’re really interested in with big o notation, are differences of orders of magnitude. So it’s common to leave out the coefficients and describe algorithms simply as having o of terms just related to n (e.g., n squared) complexity. In fact, the “o” in big o notation, stands for the order of the function. There also exist Big Ω (Omega) Notation, which expresses the best-case efficiency of an algorithm, and Big θ (Theta) Notation, which expresses the typical-case efficiency of an algorithm. Big O is used most commonly. These various values exist, though, because some algorithms are generally very efficiency, but are very inefficient with certain types of data. For example, there exists a sorting algorithm called QuickSort that is generally extremely efficient, but whose efficiency plummets if there are a lot of duplicate values in the data set that it’s sorting. Common Big O Values: table th:first-of-type { width: 10%; } table th:nth-of-type(2) { width: 20%; } table th:nth-of-type(3) { width: 35%; } Name Big O Notation Definition Example Constant !$O(1)$ The same number of operations is required regardless of the size of the data set. “Is the first name in the data set ‘David’?” Linear !$O(n)$ The number of operations required increases linearly with the size of the data set. “Is the name ‘David’ in this unsorted list of names?” (Linear Search) Quadratic !$O(n^2)$ The number of operations required increases with the size of the data set squared. “Are there any duplicate names in this unsorted list of names?” (Double-Linear Search) Polynomial !$O(n^3)$ The number of operations required increases with the size of the data set raised to a larger exponent. “Are there any triple duplicate names in this unsorted list of names?” (Triple-Linear Search) Exponential !$O(2^n)$ The number of operations required increases by a constant raised to the size of the data set. “What is every possible 10-digit password?” Logarithmic !$O(log(n))$ The number of operations required increases with the square root of the size of the data set. “Is the name ‘David’ in this sorted list of names?” (Binary Search) Loglinear !$O(nlog(n))$ The number of operations required increases with square root of the size of the data set times the size of the data set.

Recursion is a programming method characterized by functions that, during their operation, call additional copies of themselves; see also, recursion. Recursion involves breaking down a problem into smaller instances recursively until each of them can be independently solved. Solutions to these smaller instances combine to form the solution for the original problem. It keeps calling another version of itself until it reaches some default condition. This is a little bit related to our idea of a stack. We kept adding new functions on top of the stack until we reached the bottom. And then we removed them in the opposite order from how we added them. This is why we noted that the stack was more common than the queue in computing, where calls are added to the top until one is ready to return something. The important thing is that the first one to return was the last one to be called. Examples include facrotial, Fibonacci sequence The recursive implementation of Fibonacci is very inefficient. We could make it more efficient if we replace these calls of Fibonacci directly with a function that looks up and sees “have I already calculated the Fibonacci number at this location?” And if so, just go ahead and grab that value instead of recalculating it manually. We would probably do that with a dictionary, where the keys in the dictionary are locations in the sequence and the values are the Fibonacci numbers at those locations. In doing so, we remove all those duplicate calls to Fibonacci with the same value that are used before. Head recursion and tail recursion: Head recursion occurs when the recursive call is near the beginning of the function, before other reasoning or code. Tail recursion occurs when the recursive call is closer to the end of the function, after some other reasoning or code. Notice that the way I’ve written this function right now it would first print all the files in the current folder and then it would dive into the sub folders. So if we ran this we would see all the files and directory first, followed by all the files in the first folder found within directory, followed by all the files found in the first folder within that folder, and so on. If I had reversed these though, then it would first print the files located in the deepest subfolder of directory. And the very last thing it would do is print the files located in the current directory itself. That’s because it would be making that recursive function call at the beginning instead of at the end. Calling the recursive function as shown here, at the end, is called tail recursion. Whereas if it was at the start, it would be called head recursion.

The only stipulation is the algorithm must have some way to judge whether one item is greater than, less than, or equal to another. Examples include bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, shell sort, quick sort, and heap sort. 🥇For some awesome visualizations of sorting algorithms in action, check out Toptal’s web site. Bubble Sort Difficulty: ⭐ Efficiency: ⚡ Complexity: !$O(n^2)$ Implementation: iterate through each item in the list one pair at a time. If that pair were in the wrong order then switch them. Repeat that process so long as a switch occurred the previous time we went through the list. When no switches are required, then that means the list was sorted. Each time we go through the list, the bubble sort finds the largest number that has not been in the right place and puts it into the right spot by switching pairs. The benefit of bubble sort is that it’s actually pretty easy to write. It’s effectively– for each number in the list swap it if it’s greater than the next number, and keep a running Boolean that says true if any swaps were necessary. You reset that boolean to false at the end of each execution, but rerun the bubble sort if it was true at the end of the execution. The drawback of a bubble sort is it’s actually pretty inefficient. A lot of swaps were unnecessary. So it’s probably the easiest sort to implement, but it also operates in an inefficient time– o of n squared. (Orange arrows stand for iterations) def BubbleSort(list): #Set swap_occurred to True to guarantee the loop runs once swap_occurred = True #Run the loop as long as a swap occurred the previous time while swap_occurred: #Start off assuming a swap did not occur swap_occurred = False #For every item in the list except the last one... for i in range(len(list) - 1): #If the item should swap with the next item then swap if list[i] \u003e list[i + 1]: list[i], list[i+1] = list[i + 1], list[i] # Record that a swap has occurred swap_occurred =True return list Selection Sort Difficulty: ⭐⭐ Efficiency: ⚡⚡ Complexity: !$O(n^2)$ Implementation: go through the list, find the lowest or the first item, and move that item to the beginning. Then go through starting with the second item, find the next lowest item, and continue. Each time we go through the list, the selection sort finds the smallest number that has not been in the right place and puts it into the right spot directly. Because on that first run, it guaranteed it would find the very first number that should be in the list, it starts the second run by searching just from the second number onwards. After each run of selection sort, a new number at the beginning of the list is now in the right location. Notice also that if a number ends up accidentally in the right location after a certain run, it doesn’t save selection sort an execution, because it tries to move that number into its current location. Thus, with selection sort we guarantee we’re going to go through the list n times, where n is the number of items in the list. Because even if an element in the list is already in the right place, it still runs one time to try and put it in the right place. So like bubble sort, selection sort runs in o of n squared. We still repeatedly compare every pair but we track the lowest and move it to the beginning. Selection sort cannot skip iterations of the sort, so there will always be one fewer iteration than items in the list. The answer is one fewer iteration because when items 1 through n - 1 are sorted, item n is guaranteed to be sorted, too.

Search algorithms are far more efficient than sorting algorithms. In many ways sorting algorithms are just repeated search algorithms that react to the results by moving values around. Thus, a sorting algorithm operates kind of like searching for each value in the list, one by one. Linear Search Complexity: !$O(n)$ A linear search is exactly what you would do if you were searching for a name on an unsorted list or a number in an unsorted list of numbers. You check every item one by one, and when you found the right one you’d stop. The benefit of the linear search is that it works whether or not the list is sorted. Binary Search Complexity: !$O(log(n))$ A binary search on the other hand, works only if the list is already sorted. It’s a recursive method. And it starts by selecting the middle item from the list. If there is no middle item, it’ll choose randomly. Or it might always use the lower, one or the higher one, doesn’t really matter which. Linear Search vs. Merge Sort + Binary Search The drawback of binary search is that the list must be sorted. So, is it more efficient to do a linear search, or is it more efficient to do a binary search after doing a merge sort? Just look at the complexity we can get the conclusion that, in general, linear search is going to be much more efficient. And that has nothing to do with the efficiency of the binary search, since merge sort is already !$log(n)$ times slower than a linear search. Complexity of Linear Search: !$O(n)$ Complexity of Merge Sort + Binary Search: !$O(nlog(n))+O(log(n))$ So if we have an unsorted list and we’re only looking for one value, then a linear search will always be more efficient than sorting and then using a binary search. However, if you’re going to be searching more than once, that advantage disappears pretty quickly. Imagine you have a list with 100 elements. Sorting that list will require about 800 operations, and then you need at most 7 searches to find any given item in that list. A single linear search on an unsorted list of 100 takes 100 operations. So if we’re going to do as few as nine searches per time, it’s actually more efficient to do a merge sort followed by binary searches. The merge sort incurs a one time flat cost of 800 operations, but the binary search saves us 93 operations per time. So at nine searches, it will require 900 operations with a linear search, but 863 with a merge sort followed by binary searches. Then for every subsequent round, we’re saving 93 additional operations by sorting first.

The functino never knows your variables and you never know the function’s variables. When passing by value, you’re simply handing off the value and the function can’t actually change your variable. Passing by reference: The function has access to your actual variables and could modify them. You and the function are accessing the same variables. When passing by reference, you’re handing the variable itself to the function and the function can modify the variable if it wants. The difference between passing by value and passing by reference comes down to whether or not you want the function to be able to change the values of the variables directly, or if you simply want it to receive the values themselves without being able to access the variables. (whether the function has the direct access to your original files📕) In some languages like C++, you can choose whether to pass a variable by value or by reference. However, Python deals with passing-by-value and passing-by-reference a little strangely. In reality, everything is passed by reference, but some primitive data types like integers often appear to be passing by value. This is due to mutability.

Mutable Variable: A variable whose value can change after it has been declared. Immutable Variable: A variable whose value cannot change after it has been declared. Python passes all arguments by reference. But for all practical purposes, some data types seem to be passed by value. The reason they acted this way is because they were immutable. Let’s talk about the way Python actually does this. We have a variable called myInteger, and we assign it the value 1, we’re telling it to point to a place in memory that stores the number 1. When we use myInteger, we’re actually looking up its value. Now when we say myInteger equals 2, what Python does is kind of weird. It grabs a new area of memory, puts the number 2 there, and tells myInteger to point out that new location instead of the old location. What that means is that the old value is still there in memory. The value didn’t change. We didn’t change the number 1. Instead, we just created a new place in memory and told myInteger to point to that instead. Changing the value of myInteger changes the spot in memory that it points to, but it doesn’t actually change the value stored in the original spot of memory. Note that a function can’t change what value the variable used in the main program is pointing to. It can only change the value its own copy of that variable is pointing to. (Because the scope of variables defined in the function were until the function ended.) The computer has to have some way of identifying the location in memory that stores the data. Multiple names or different names can point to the same place in memory, so the place memory really needs a fundamental unchangeable name. This is called a memory address. It tells the computer where to find a particular value for a particular variable name. print(id(variable/value)) # Printing Memory Addresses Immutable data types: integers, float, strings (Changing them changes the address where they can be found, seem like passing by value.) Mutable data types: lists (Changing them does not change the address where they can be found. note that it’s changing/modifying them, not reassigning them to a whole new value.)

It would encompass other data structures like dictionaries and maps. Homogeneity: A property of lists determining whether they can accept multiple types of variables. A homogenous list can only accept one type of variable; a nonhomogenous or heterogenous list can accept multiple types. Nearly every programming language has some concept of a list, but the terminology and the specific details differ significantly. One major way different languages differ in their implementations of lists is mutability. Mutability of a list involces: whether the values of the list can be changed whether the size of the list can be changed Some list implementations will allow us to append new items to the end, while others require you to state in advance how many items can fit in the list. Generally, the latter is more common for lower level languages like C where we manage memory more deliberately. Another major way list-like structures may differ is whether they accept multiple data types. This is called homogeneity and lists. In some list implementations, every item in a list must be the same type. Other languages don’t have this restriction. A list is a data structure that contains multiple values accessed via an ordered numerical index. This is in contrast to dictionaries and hash tables and other data structures. They can also contain multiple values, but they can be accessed via non-numeric indices. List-like structures can go by various different names like lists, arrays, tuples, vectors, tables, and more. Oftentimes, array is used to refer to a more primitive structure that only supports changing the existing values, whereas list refers to more complex data structures that support sorting and inserting and other operations. Tuples are, most often, immutable.

Tuple: An immutable form of a list-like structure in Python. Like strings, we can’t add values to the end of a tuple and we can’t change the current values of anything inside the tuple or sort them. Lists: A mutable form of a list-like structure in Python. Declare a tuple: tuple = (value1, value2, value3) Tuples can have multiple data types within them. This follows Python’s general procedure of being what we call loosely typed. Python never really cares about what data types you’re using until you try to do something that you can’t do, like multiplying a string by a float, or printing the length of an integer. Tuples can be accessed and sliced as other list-like data structures. However, they also have a fancy little syntax for unpacking: (variable1, variable2, variable3) = tuple What this does is it one by one assigns the values of the tuple to the different variables contained on the right side of this assignment statement. The most usefulness of tuples may be functions. Generally functions can only return one variable or one value. But since tuples can pack multiple values into just one, they in some way let us return multiple values out of a function: def function(args): function body return (value1, value2, value3) # return a tuple allows a function to return multiple values (variable1, variable2, variable3) = function(args) # assignment using tuple unpacking Tuples can be nested.

Everything we’ve seen in the past with both strings and tuples can also be used for lists. The only real difference is that whereas we define a string with quotation marks and a tuple with parentheses, we define a list with brackets. (access, slice, unpacking, function return, nested…) What differentiates lists is that they’re mutable. That means we can change their values. We can add values to them, we can remove values from them, we can change the current value of certain values in the list. We can reorder them. list.sort() # A method inside the list data type and sorts the values according to some internal logic. For integers it just sorts from the lowest to the highest (ascending). list.reverse() # reverses the current order of the list, not necessarily the sorted order of the list. list1.extend(list2) # takes the values of list2 and puts them at the end of list1. list.insert(location, value) # inserts an item at a certain place in the list. list.remove(value) # removes a certain value. del list[] # deletes items by location in the list. list.pop([index=-1]) # removes the last item (by default) of the list and returns it, index is optional. list.index(value) # finds the index of a certain value. list.count(value) # counts how many times a certain value appears. list.copy() # returns a shallow copy of the list. Equivalent to a[:]. list.clear() # removes all items from the list. Equivalent to del a[:]. It’s important to note that calling the method actually changes the value of the list. Remember, when we called methods on strings they didn’t change the value of the string. That’s because lists are mutable, and strings are immutable. The sorted(list) function can also be used for sorting, but it does not change the value of the original list. It can be applied to any Iterable object, which means that it also accepts strings, sets, dictionaries when they are passed to it. Difference between .extend() and .append(): extend(), on the one hand, takes an iterable (list, set, tuple or string), and adds each element of the iterable to the list one at a time. append(), on the other hand, adds its argument to the end of the list as a single item, which means that when the append() function takes an iterable as its argument, it will treat it as a single object. extend() is a more efficient version of calling append() multiple times. Lists are mutable. That means if we pass a list to a function or method and change the values of the list, those changes will persist out to our main program. So when dealing with lists, or any other mutable data type, we have to be careful to understand that all modifications we make to the list will persist.

We use lists when the ability to add or remove from the list would actually be useful and relevant. We usually use lists when the individual things on the list are qualitatively similar. We use tuples if they’re qualitatively different. Lists are used for alike data types by convention because we tend to execute the same body of code for each item in the list. Tuples are more often used to represent information that’s unpacked into unique variables, those have qualitatively different meanings. And so you’re not going to just run some code on every item in a tuple. For that same reason, it’s more normal for tuples to have different data types within them because we’re not generally expecting to be able to iterate over a tuple in the same way. If you’re defining a constant set of values and all you’re going to do with it is iterate through it, use a tuple instead of a list.

File types set up rules for how to interpret a file, and a program can only correctly interpret the file if it knows those rules. Many languages actually require that file input and output be enclosed within a try block. Reading simply means that we’re looking at the file’s contents and reading it into our program. We’re not changing the contents, just inputting it into our own code. Writing, on the other hand, means we’re rewriting the file from scratch. When we write to a file, we, by default, erase it and rewrite it completely from scratch. With writing, we assume the file is a snapshot of the current state of our data, not a running log of the history of all of its changes.

Or, more simply, lines of code that control when other lines of code run. They allow us to loop over certain lines of code multiple times, changing the data that they act on each time. Conditional Statements: Programming statements that control what code is executed based on certain conditions; usually of the form “if”, “else if”, and “else”. Loop: A programming control structure that executes a segment of code multiple times. Function: A segment of code that performs a specific task, sometimes taking some input and sometimes returning some output. (Eg. purchasing something is a common behavior regardless of what you’re buying. The steps are always the same: get the total, swipe or insert your card, enter your PIN, sign your name, and remove the card. So, we can imagine grouping those actions together into a common function to use.) Exception: An error that a program might want to anticipate and catch instead of outright avoiding. Exception Handling: A control structure that catches certain anticipated errors and reacts to them accordingly. Condition vs. Exception: Conditionals are most often decisions when the computer has access to all the necessary information. The condition is intentionally checked. Exception handling also feels like a decision, but typically exception handling occurs when we didn’t check some piece of information beforehand. (Eg. we don’t usually check for an insufficient balance, but it could occur.) Indentation: Spaces at the beginning of a line that are used to group together blocks of code. All consecutive lines of code at the same level of indentation are in a single code block. Scope: The portion of a program’s execution during which a variable can be seen and accessed. Similar to a computer’s short-term memory. A single variable usually lives within the control structures definition. And once the computer leaves that control structure, the variable is lost. So the code that runs after the conditional can’t see any variables that were created inside of it. The reason is that the computer can’t guarantee that the contents of a conditional statement actually ran. 🧐 Note that in Python, a variable created in a control structure lives since the line it is created (and run) to the end of the code, which is a bit wierd though. 🤔 In other languages like Java, for example, if you define a variable inside a conditional, then the variable ceases to exist when the condition is done. 😓 🤓So, it’s better to never create variables inside a conditional that will need to be accessed outside the conditional. Functions define scope even more narrowly. A function scope is generally just a variable sent to it or created within it. Functions don’t automatically see anything created before their run. They only see those things that are sent into them intentionally.

For-Each Loop: A loop control structure that runs a block of code a predetermined number of times, where the number of times comes from the length of some list and the items in the list are automatically loaded into a variable for usage in the block of code. Iterate: To repeat code a number of times. Iteration: A single execution of a repeated task or block of code. While Loop: A loop control structure that runs a block of code until a certain logical expression is not satisfied. They run while something remains true. Anything we can express in a for loop can also be expressed in a while loop. But not all loops are interchangeable. For loops must have some pre-knowledge about the number of times it should run. Some languages also have a special kind of while loop called a do while loop. We can think of the standard while loop that we talked about before as a while do loop–while a condition is true, do something. A do while loop is identical except that it guarantees the something will be run at least once. It does it before checking the condition the first time.

Nothing we do to that variable inside the body of this loop will be carried over to the next time that loop runs. No matter what has been done with the variable within the body of the loop, it will take the next value in the list. Actually, in Python, every for loop is a for-each loop. It runs the indented code for each item in the list given. In a for loop, range() is used so that you know exactly how many iterations have occurred, but you have to manually look up each item by its index. In a for-each loop, a pre-defined list is used, you iterate directly over the items, but you have to use other ways to get the index (list.index(value)). 📕When we’re just printing, we’ll sometimes just use commas instead, and then we don’t have to worry about actually converting an integer into a string. But input is a different function. It’s not the print function, and it doesn’t know how to put together variables the same way as our print function does. So, here, if we want to use a variable that holds an integer in the prompt that we give to our user, we have to explicitly convert it to a string.

Keyword parameter/named parameter/optional parameter is a special kind of optional parameter to which the program may choose to assign an argument during a function call, or may ignore. Typically, keyword parameters have a default value that is used if it is not overridden by a function call. For positional parameters, Python assumes that arguments come in the order that parameters are defined in a function definition. For keyword parameters, we have to use the variable names, because Python can’t assume anything based on the order of these parameters. Keyword (optional) parameters must go after all positional (required) parameters. But the order of the keyward parameters themselves is not important. def f(pos1, pos2, /, pos_or_kwd, *, kwd1, kwd2): where / and * are optional. If used, these symbols indicate the kind of parameter by how the arguments may be passed to the function: parameters before the / are positional-only; parameters between / and * are positional-or-keyword; parameters after the * are keyword-only. *name receives a tuple containing some positional arguments; **name receives a dictionary containing some keyword arguments. \u003e Eg., if we define a function like this: def cheeseshop(kind, *arguments, **keywords): print(\"-- Do you have any\", kind, \"?\") print(\"-- I'm sorry, we're all out of\", kind) for arg in arguments: print(arg) print(\"-\" * 40) for kw in keywords: print(kw, \":\", keywords[kw]) It could be called like this: cheeseshop(\"Limburger\", \"It's very runny, sir.\", \"It's really very, VERY runny, sir.\", shopkeeper=\"Michael Palin\", client=\"John Cleese\", sketch=\"Cheese Shop Sketch\") and of course it would print: -- Do you have any Limburger ? -- I'm sorry, we're all out of Limburger It's very runny, sir.

Uncaught Error: An error that is not handled by error handling code, and thus usually forces the program to crash. Sometimes, instead of preventing errors, we want to use the fact that an error arose to direct or control our program. The actual structure of error handling is itself a control structure. The three main structures for exception handling in most languages are the try, catch, and finally statements: The Try statement marks a block of code to attempt, but in which we anticipate an error might arise. Error handling is kind of like a conditional statement. We could handle errors with a conditional by saying, if an error is going to arise, don’t run this code. Else, do run it. In that structure, we would put the code that we actually want to run in the else portion of the structure. The try block is thus similar to the else block. It’s a block of code marked off to run if some other code didn’t take place. However, the try block is slightly different in that it will always try to run, and stop only when an error is encountered. The Catch statement names the errors to anticipate, and marks a block of code to run if an anticipated error arises. (Python often refers to this as the Except block as well.) When a try block didn’t succeed, and encountered an error, the computer jumps forward to the catch block (except: in Python). It contains the code the computer should run if an expected error was encountered. The catch block also has one additional detail declared with it– the type of error to be expected. We can tell the computer exactly what kind of error to catch. In some languages, we can even skip the catch block altogether. A try without a catch just tells the computer not to crash if the code inside the try block raises any kind of error. The Finally statement marks a block of code to run after the above two blocks no matter what. The finally block contains code that should be executed after the code in the try block whether it succeeded or not. If the code in the try block ran without errors, then execution will jump to the finally block when the try block is done. If the code in the try block did hit an error execution, will in most languages, run what is in the catch block next and then will always run the code in the finally block. The finally block is typically used for code that absolutely needs to run, even if other things have gone wrong. 🐍Python is not a language that allows a try without catching something, So we need to include both the try and the catch. 🐍In Python, there is also an Else block for exception handling: it runs some code only if no errors arose in the Try block. Most languages have a Finally statement, but Else (at least as it applies to error handling) is relatively unique to Python.

The code would then execute whatever is inside that except block. Then, once these two control structures– this try and this except– are done, execution continues as normal. Every Try block in Python must have a corresponding Except block (catch block). In terms of natural language, we can think of this as saying try to do this except if something goes wrong, in which case, do this. Or in other words, try this except if this error happens. The keyword as in Python basically takes whatever the error was and assigns the message associated with that specific error to the variable name after the keyword as. except ValueError as error_message: print(error_message) Notice that no matter how many errors occur in the try block, as soon as the code encounters the first, it jumps over the rest of the try block and starts to check the except blocks. Three kinds of except block could be used to handle specific errors: Catch a specific error \u0026 customized message except ValueError as error: # if a ValueError was encountered print(\"Can't convert; myString is not a number\") Catch a specific error \u0026 pre-determined message except block is similar to if block except ValueError as error: # if a ValueError was encountered print(error) except TypeError as error: # if a TypeError was encountered print(error) print(\"Done!\") Catch multiple specific errors except (TypeEror, ValueError) as error: print(\"A ValueError or TypeError occurred.\") except Exception as error: # Catch any type of error print(\"Some other type of error occurred.\") print(\"Done!\") The except block with parentheses will run if any of the errors given in that parentheses were encountered. Since the error type Exception catches any kind of error, this code will never crash.

The else block basically says, if no error was encountered, then run the code inside this block. 🤔—Why we need an else block? Why not just include this code down here after the try and catch blocks? 🤖—Style is everything! In many languages, it’s normal to have huge blocks of code inside of a try block, even though the expected errors might only occur in one or two places. The else block lets us restrict this try block to only those lines of code that might actually generate an error. The else block will only run, if no errors were encountered. So we can trust that everything inside the try block happened successfully before running the things inside that else block. Example: File Input This code below opens a file and then prints every line of text that was found inside that file. And then at the end, it closes the file again. Here, we’re trying to catch an IOError, an input/output error, inside this try block. It only happens when the code tries to read from a file that does not exist (eg., in function open()). try: input_file = open(\"InputFile.txt\", mode = \"r\") except IOError as error: print(\"An input error occurred!\") else: for line in input_file: print(line) input_file.close() open(filename): Takes as input a filename and returns the file. Once returned, the file can be read line-by-line or written to, depending on the mode. Mode is set with the keyword parameter “mode”, “r” for read, “w” for write, “a” for append. filename.close(): A method that closes the file of which it’s a member. Some languages actually require file input and output to be enclosed in try/catch blocks because of how frequently they generate errors. Python, however, has a more laissez-faire attitude and will let us mess up if we want to.

Line of code: A single command. Program: A collection of lines of code that serve one or more overall functions. Input (files, user input, websites) 👉 code 👉 output (files, screen, sound) Compile: To translate human-readable computer code into low-level commands the computer can execute. In the programming flow, this functions as reading over code and looking for errors. (proofreading by compilers) Run/Execution: Running some code and having it actually perform its operations. Compiling just makes sure what we told the program to do makes sense; running checks whether the program actually do what we want it to do. Compilation could potentially be skipped. Languages that require compilation are called static/compiled languages. Languages that do not require compilation are called dynamic/interpreted languages. Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: interpreters and compilers. An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations. A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts running. In this case, the high-level program is called the source code, and the translated program is called the object code or the executable. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation. Many modern languages use both processes. They are first compiled into a lower level language, called byte code, and then interpreted by a program called a virtual machine. Python uses both processes, but because of the way programmers interact with it, it is usually considered an interpreted language.

The object does not have the attribute. SyntaxError An error occurs when the line of code we’ve written can’t be read by the computer because it doesn’t match the computer’s expectation for the programming language’s grammar. Usually, unclosed parentheses will cause a SyntaxError on the next line of code. But depending on your code, unclosed parentheses can actually manifest as other kinds of errors. For example, if it was actually the last line that had a missing close-parentheses, you would still get a syntax error, but it would read “unexpected EOF while parsing”. EOF stands for “end of file” and “parsing” is a fancy word for “reading”, so “unexpected EOF while parsing” means that Python encountered the end of the file before it expected to.

In strongly-typed languages, assigning a type to a variable is actually a separate step from assigning a value to the variable; and assigning a different type to this variable will cause crashing. We can multiply a sequence (string, list…) by an integer, and Python just takes that sequence and repeats it however many times we multiplied it by. But we can’t multiply a sequence by a float or a string by a string. Also, when Python is asked to use a boolean like a number (such as multiplying by a boolean), it interprets True as 1 and False as 0. Now, let’s meet a weird guy in Python—the NoneType—which only has one value: None. None is Python’s implementation of the programming concept of ==null== (like the null pointer in C++). This is how Python represents that a variable has no value. This is slightly different from a variable simply not existing: ==the variable name exists, it just doesn’t point to any value==. Because there is no value, it also doesn’t fit into any of the above types. Where Does None Come From? First, the trivial way, we could just do that intentionally.

Implicit conversion: In practice, you may not always need to do this manually, though. For example, when you put a value other than a string into Python’s print function, it automatically tries to convert it to a string. When we use comma instead of plus sign, it tells the print statement to interpret each individual thing in the parentheses as a separate piece of data. The print statement ==implicitly converts each thing to a string if needed and then puts them together==. By default, it puts each thing together separated by a space. You’ll receive a ==ValueError== whenever you try to do a type conversion, like float or integer, on a value that can’t actually be converted to that type. ==int(variable)==: Takes as input some variable (usually a string) and attempts to convert it to an integer, returning the integer if successful or raising a ValueError if unsuccessful. This function will work if the variable is a string made up only of digits and, optionally, the negative sign. Note that conversion from float to int by int() just wiping out the decimal part. If you want to convert float to int type value in Python with a round figure. You have to use the round() function of Python inside the int() function. ==bool(variable)==: Takes as input some variable (usually a string) and attempts to convert it to a boolean, returning the boolean value if successful or raising a ValueError if unsuccessful. Generally, this function returns False if the variable is 0 or an empty string, True if the variable is anything else. ==float(variable)==: Takes as input some variable (usually a string/integer) and attempts to convert it to a float, returning the float if successful or raising a ValueError if unsuccessful. This function will work if the variable is a string made up only of digits and, optionally, a negative sign and a decimal point. The computer interprets anything that the user enters by the ==input(variable)== function as a string of characters because it has no way of knowing that it’s a number. So, type conversion is needed under certain circumstances. Usually, int(input(variable)) is used if we want to use the user input as a number.

Numeric Comparison Operators Operators that facilitate numeric comparison between values. Typically, these are ‘greater than’ (\u003e), ‘greater than or equal to’ (\u003e=), ‘equal to’ (==), ‘less than’ (\u003c), and ‘less than or equal to’ (\u003c=). These operators can sometimes be used for comparisons that are not numeric, but that nonetheless have an underlying order: A string of characters is ‘less’ than another string if it comes earlier alphabetically. “Apple” would be less than “Banana”. “Z” would be less than “a”. “12” would be less than “3”. “Quick” \u003c “Quicker”, “Quicker” \u003c “Quickly” A date is ‘less’ than another date if it comes earlier in time. January 1st, 2017 would be ‘less’ than January 15th, 2017. It’s also worth noting that the greater than and less than operators do work for strings as well, and they operate based on sorting the strings alphabetically. Besides, in Python, all capital letters are sorted before all lowercase letters, so a string beginning with a capital Z would be treated as less than a string beginning with a lowercase a. Non-Numeric Equality Comparisons Nearly any kind of data can compare for equality, even if it isn’t numeric. We can’t ask if an apple is greater than an orange, but we can ask if apples and oranges are ‘equal’, or the same thing. In practice, sometimes this will compare values to see if the values of two variables are the same, and other times it will compare if two variables are pointing to the same data in memory. It could be that two variables have the same values, but those values are stored in separate places, and so the computer doesn’t recognize them as equal. Set Operators Check to see if a value is a member of a set of multiple values. Most often this comes up in strings and lists. With strings, we can check to see if a certain smaller string occurs inside a larger string. For example, “cde” is in the string “abcdefg”, but “ijk” is not. With lists, we can check to see if a certain item is on our list. For example, if we had a list containing “grapes”, “apples”, and “oranges”, then “apples” would be in that set, but “papaya” would not. Relational Operators in Python In many of these examples, we’ll have a logical expression, and we’ll set the result of it equal to a variable. Then, we can check the variable to see what the result of the expression was. We may also print the results of a logical expression directly. Note that a single equal sign (=) is for assignment, while a double equal sign (==) is for comparison. The ==in== operator checks to see if something is contained within a list of other things. For one example, we can use the in operator in the context of strings to see if a certain smaller string is contained within a larger string. Note, the empty string ==\"\"== is in all the strings.

The reason for that is that whenever we do addition, subtraction, or multiplication on integers, we’re guaranteed to end up with an integer. However when we do division, we might end up with a decimal number. And it’s probably worth noting that this actually sets Python apart from other languages as well. Some other languages will automatically round down when you round integers. But if there is a float anywhere in a mathematical expression, Python automatically converts the other type to a float, and the result will also be a float. Eg. the result of 1.5//2 is 0.0. Besides, the Modulus Operation will only return the remainder having the same sign as the divisor. Eg. the result of -8%3 is 1, the result of 8%-3 is -1, and the result of -8%-3 is -2. Python specifically supplies two additional operators: Floor division, represented by a double-slash (\\\\), which is division that rounds down to the next lowest integer (not round towards 0). For example, 5 // 2 would be 2, because 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, which is rounded down to the nearest integer, 2. Exponentiation, represented by a double-asterisk (**), which raises the first number to the second number. For example, 5 ** 2 would be 25, because 5 raised to the 2nd power is 25.

Increment: Repeatedly adding a constant, typically one, to a variable. Self-assignment reveals something very important about the assignment operator: Python (and most other programming languages) will evaluate everything on the right side of the assignment before attempting to assign the result to the variable on the left. That’s why self-assignment works: Python initially replaces the variables with their values, so by the time we assign a new value to a variable, Python doesn’t remember that the variable receiving a new value was used in the calculation. Self-Assignment Shortcuts: +=, -=, *=, **=, /=, //=, %= Sometimes these shortcuts even work for those strange non-mathematical applications of these mathematical operators. For example, we can use the shortcut += to add something to an existing string.

These are the same in Python, Java, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, VB.NET, Matlab, Swift, and Ruby: a \u003c b: Less than a \u003c= b: Less than or equal to a == b: Equal to a \u003e= b: Greater than or equal to a \u003e b: Greater than If a and b are not the same type, JavaScript will automatically try to convert them to the same type before comparison.

我们可能会感到疑惑🤔：为什么画面中的马太一脸讶异，为什么圣彼得要反复追问？ 原来，税吏这一职业在当时人们心目中是十分罪恶的，税吏马太无疑会被人当作罪人。而圣人耶稣竟然愿意感召一名罪人，就连马太自己也感到诚惶诚恐。😱 罗马共和国时期，一方面，国土不断扩张，大量的财富与人口涌入罗马，财政事务复杂；另一方面，系统完备的财政管理机构和制度始终没有形成，管理水平低下。大量的财富资源得不到有效合理的安排与利用，严重阻碍了罗马经济的健康发展。税负加重，人民生活日益贫困，消费市场日渐萎缩，农业衰落又使工商业生产原料减少，而手工业和商业的衰落进一步影响到帝国的税收收入，最终帝国的税收与财政到了崩盘的边缘。因此，这个时代的税吏实属罪大恶极的职业。😈 另一方面，这也体现了耶稣的怜悯。马太福音中记载了圣马太蒙召之后的一段故事： 为了感谢他（耶稣），马太在他家里举行了盛大的宴会。有好几个税吏和罪人和耶稣与他的门徒坐在一起。法利赛人和他们的文士看见了，就问耶稣的门徒：“你们的主人为什么与税吏和罪人一起吃饭呢？”当他听到这句话时，他回答说：“需要医生的不是健康的人，而是病人。去学习这句话的意思：怜悯是我所喜悦的，而不是牺牲。的确，我不是来召叫正直人，而是召叫罪人。” 我们再回到画面，当“信仰之光”✨打在马太困惑的脸上，他的两颊由于忽被“点名”而变得通红。对于神圣的召唤，他做出了每个罗马人、每个朝圣者都会认出的反应：“什么？我？”有些学者说，此处的圣马太是谁其实难以确定。也许这位大胡子男🧔🏼指向的是另一个人——桌子尽头弓着背的年轻人，嘴里说的是：“你是指他吗？”（暗示这位年轻人是马太）；还有一些人认为卡拉瓦乔的画是故意模棱两可的。但在我而言，毫无疑问，即将成为门徒马太的就是这个满脸胡须的人。因为他衣着华丽，也是卡拉瓦乔自己最喜欢的黑天鹅绒，这就使得税吏向谦卑的皈依更加生动。

基督没有在画面正中，而是身处黑暗，这引得观者去寻找他的存在。而那束光给了我们绝妙的提示。从神学角度说，这是完美的处理，因为圣彼得介于众人和基督之间，就像他在教会制度中的作用一样。这种处理在心理层面也很出色，因为基督仅仅展现出部分身体，这就将大家的注意力都放在一个无法忽视的部位：他伸出的胳膊和有指向的手指。这是神圣与世俗的完美结合，而且也正是整个故事的核心。 ==耶稣的这个手势源于米开朗基罗的西斯廷天顶画《创造亚当》==，他伸出的右手，几乎是亚当左手的镜像。==上帝的手指与亚当的手指即将触碰，象征着神的智慧和灵性即将随着灵魂一起注入人体；同样地，耶稣将这一手势传递下去，将神的宽恕给予他的使徒。== 卡拉瓦乔之所以在描摹耶稣时借用《创造亚当》中亚当的手势，是因为耶稣在新约中被描绘为==最后的亚当==或==第二个亚当==(the Last Adam/the Second adam)。在圣经新约中，保罗将耶稣和亚当进行了两次明确的比较： 因一人的悖逆，众人成为罪人；照样，因一人的顺从，众人也成为义了。 ——罗马书 5:19 在亚当里众人都死了。照样，在基督里众人也都要复活。 ——哥林多前书 15:22 而在 45 节中，他称耶稣为 ==“最后的/终极的/最终的亚当” (the last/ultimate/final Adam)==。 我们再来看看卡拉瓦乔的酒窖式光线。在《圣马太蒙召》中，一束光线似乎自耶稣头顶（而不是来自肮脏的窗户），顺着他的手，射向了画面的左侧。这里很多学者曾对窗户的作用提出了疑问。有的人认为窗户是为了光线的漫反射而存在。但我觉得，比较令人信服的说法是，这里暗淡的窗户象征着教会：它只是一种形式，并不能带来真正的光芒；真正的福音之光源自于基督，源自于对耶稣的信仰。 特点总结

这幅画的戏剧性在于，这一刻，没有人做任何事情，但我们都能预见下一秒将发生什么。 基督这一瞬时的出现是如此出人意料；他的姿态如此威严，以至于在场的每一个人在发生反应之前都暂停了行动。再过一秒，马太就会站起来跟随基督而去——他腿部动势和肌肉的曲张已经暴露了这一点。另外，仔细观察画面右下角也能发现，基督的脚事实上已经调转了方向，仿佛就要离开这个房间。他来此只是为了告知使徒他已被选中，不做任何停留，并且心里仿佛早就知道马太会毫不犹豫地跟随自己。这幅画的特殊力量就在于这种动作的停止。有如牵丝木偶忽被拉紧了线，让人心头也倏地一震。 之后的动作虽“呼之欲出”且“显而易见”，却也留足了悬念，给了观者思考与想象的空间。==它利用了绘画最基本的静态感传达出了人类动态的情感——在面临挑战或命令，并且尚未来得及反应之时的，那种典型的内心矛盾与犹豫不决。==

画面分为两部分。基督和圣彼得矗立在右侧，形成了一个竖直的矩形；画面左侧围坐在桌子旁的人们形成了一个水平的模块。卡拉瓦乔以鲜艳的色彩使这幅画栩栩如生：红色、金色和绿色的大胆对比。此外，天鹅绒和软毛皮等各种质地的服装也加强了人物的对比：仍在世俗纷争中苦苦挣扎的利未和他的部下们，穿着具有当代风格的衣服；而基督和圣彼得，赤着双脚，身着具有象征意义和永恒性的斗篷，将利未召唤到另一个了无俗尘的世界。==这两个群体被一个虚空隔开，由基督的手从画面上并且从象征意义上连接了起来==。 这只手，就像米开朗基罗《创造亚当》中，亚当的手一样，在形式上和心理上统一了两部分。在画面舞台式的空间之下，是纵横交错的网格布局，将整体在结构上编织在一起。
