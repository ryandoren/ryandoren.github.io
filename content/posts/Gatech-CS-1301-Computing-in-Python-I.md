# Chapter 1.1: Computing
## Programming Vocabulary
-**Code**: Commands given to a computer in order to perform a task.
-**Line of code**: A single command.
-**Program**: A collection of lines of code that serve one or more overall functions.
-**Input** (files, user input, websites) 👉 code 👉 **output** (files, screen, sound)
-**Compile**: Reading over code and looking for errors. (proofreading by compilers)
-**Run**: When the program is actually executed.
> Compiling just makes sure what we told the program to do makes sense; running checks whether the program actually do what we want it to do.

Compilation could potentially be skipped.
-Languages that require compilation are called **static/compiled**  languages.
-Languages that do not require compilation are called **dynamic/interpreted**  languages.
*Nonetheless though, even with dynamic languages, we often mimic the workflow of static languages.*
