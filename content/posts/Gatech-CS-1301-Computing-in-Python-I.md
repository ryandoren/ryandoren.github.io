# Chapter 1.1: Computing
## Programming Vocabulary
- **Code**: Commands given to a computer in order to perform a task.
- **Line of code**: A single command.
- **Program**: A collection of lines of code that serve one or more overall functions.
- **Input** (files, user input, websites) 👉 code 👉 **output** (files, screen, sound)
- **Compile**: To translate human-readable computer code into low-level commands the computer can execute. In the programming flow, this functions as reading over code and looking for errors. (proofreading by compilers)
- **Run/Excution**: Running some code and having it actually perform its operations.
> Compiling just makes sure what we told the program to do makes sense; running checks whether the program actually do what we want it to do.

Compilation could potentially be skipped.
- Languages that require compilation are called **static/compiled**  languages.
- Languages that do not require compilation are called **dynamic/interpreted**  languages.

*Nonetheless though, even with dynamic languages, we often mimic the workflow of static languages.*

## Programming Language
Categorization of languages: 
- **Static & Dynamic**: whether compilation is required
- **Hight-level languages** involve a great deal of abstraction from the low-level details of the computer like memory, whereas **low-level languages** require these details to be addressed manually.

> C++ and C# are two successors to the programming language C, which is a low-level language used a lot in developing operating systems, video games, and other highly complex programs. C++ adds a few more features to C, while C# is more of a high-level version. Java, C, C++, and C# are static, compiled languages; Python is the top dynamic, scripting language on this list.
