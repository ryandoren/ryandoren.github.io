# Before Getting Started
## Software and Hardware Requirements
### Headset
For the most part you can use your computer to simulate your designs. However, we encourage you to use a **VR headset** for a better understanding of how VR should look and feel. We recommend the **Google Cardboard**.

### Game Engine
You are welcome to use any game engine of your choice, but we will be using **Unity**. 

## Unity Tutorials
Before taking this course, we recommend looking at some introductory Unity tutorials to familiarize yourself with the **Unity interface and C# scripting**. Though we’ll be briefly introducing these concepts, the provided Unity tutorials teach them best, and would be most helpful in providing an introduction to the game engine!
