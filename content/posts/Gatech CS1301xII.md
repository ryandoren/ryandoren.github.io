## Chapter 3.1: Control Structures
- **Control Structures:** Statements that control the flow of execution of the program. Or, more simply, lines of code that control when other lines of code run. They allow us to loop over certain lines of code multiple times, changing the data that they act on each time.
- **Conditional Statements:** Programming statements that control what code is executed based on certain conditions; usually of the form “if”, “else if”, and “else”.
